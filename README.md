## Getting Started With TensorFlow

Steps to get started with a simple machine learning problem using the sample programs of tensorflow

* Import and parse the data
* Create feature columns to describe the data
* Select the type of model
* Train the model
* Evaluate the model's effectiveness
* Let the trained model make predictions

To start with obviously the entire dataset will be separated into training and test sets.

In the sample code of tensorflow, the `premade_estimators.py` forms the bulk of the entire program. This program relies on the `load_data` function in the adjacent `iris_data.py` file to read in and parse the training and test set.

```python
TRAIN_URL = "http://download.tensorflow.org/data/iris_training.csv"
TEST_URL = "http://download.tensorflow.org/data/iris_test.csv"

CSV_COLUMN_NAMES = ['SepalLength', 'SepalWidth',
                    'PetalLength', 'PetalWidth', 'Species']

...

def load_data(label_name='Species'):
    """Parses the csv file in TRAIN_URL and TEST_URL."""

    # Create a local copy of the training set.
    train_path = tf.keras.utils.get_file(fname=TRAIN_URL.split('/')[-1],
                                         origin=TRAIN_URL)
    # train_path now holds the pathname: ~/.keras/datasets/iris_training.csv

    # Parse the local CSV file.
    train = pd.read_csv(filepath_or_buffer=train_path,
                        names=CSV_COLUMN_NAMES,  # list of column names
                        header=0  # ignore the first row of the CSV file.
                       )
    # train now holds a pandas DataFrame, which is data structure
    # analogous to a table.

    # 1. Assign the DataFrame's labels (the right-most column) to train_label.
    # 2. Delete (pop) the labels from the DataFrame.
    # 3. Assign the remainder of the DataFrame to train_features
    train_features, train_label = train, train.pop(label_name)

    # Apply the preceding logic to the test set.
    test_path = tf.keras.utils.get_file(TEST_URL.split('/')[-1], TEST_URL)
    test = pd.read_csv(test_path, names=CSV_COLUMN_NAMES, header=0)
    test_features, test_label = test, test.pop(label_name)

    # Return four DataFrames.
    return (train_features, train_label), (test_features, test_label)
```
